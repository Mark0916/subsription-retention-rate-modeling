# subsription-retention-rate-modeling

The goal of this exercise is to create a model that predicts monthly retention rate for the different subscription price points and to answer the below questions:
1. For the different subscription price points, what is the predicted monthly retention rate?
2. For each price point, what percentage of users is still subscribed after at least 12 months?
3. How do user country and source affect subscription retention rate?
4. How would you use these findings to improve the company revenue?
